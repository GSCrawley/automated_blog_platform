# Automated Blog Platform (Headless GPT-5 Marketing Stack Pivot)

## Project Overview

The Automated Blog Platform is now a headless, multi-agent GPT-5 Marketing Stack that generates, optimizes, and manages SEO-focused affiliate content with minimal human intervention. The original WordPress coupling has been fully removed—content is produced and optimized in a headless layer ready for downstream publishing (static sites, CMS adapters, API syndication) to be added later.

## Core System Objectives

- **Automated Content Generation**: Generate high-quality, SEO-optimized articles on trending high-ticket products with minimal human intervention
- **SEO Optimization**: Ensure all generated content and blog platforms are fully optimized for search engines
- **Affiliate Marketing Integration**: Seamlessly embed strategically placed affiliate links within content
- **Trending Product Identification**: Automatically identify and analyze currently trending high-ticket products
- **Periodic Content Updates**: Automate the process of updating existing articles to maintain freshness and relevance
- **Multi-Blog Management**: Support and coordinate multiple blog instances across different niches
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Implement an agent-based system for intelligent content and marketing decisions

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular, agent-based architecture with these core components:

### Backend (Flask + SQLAlchemy)

The backend system is built with Python Flask and SQLAlchemy, providing a robust API for the frontend and agent system. Key components include:

- **Models**: Database models for articles, products, niches, and the new agent system
- **Routes**: API endpoints for CRUD operations and agent control
- **Services**: Core functionality being migrated to agent-based tools

### Frontend (React)

The React-based frontend provides a dashboard interface for monitoring and controlling the automated blog system:

- **Dashboard**: Overview of system performance and blog status
- **Article Management**: CRUD operations for blog articles
- **Product Management**: Management interface for affiliate products
- **Niche Management**: Configuration for different blog niches
- **(Removed) WordPress Integration**: Replaced by a headless content pipeline

### Multi-Agent System (In Development)

The core of the system's intelligence is its multi-agent architecture:

- **Orchestrator Agent**: Central coordinator managing all blog instances
- **Market Analytics Agent**: Researches trending products and market opportunities
- **Content Strategy Agent**: Plans and optimizes content strategies
- **Monetization Agent**: Optimizes affiliate strategies and revenue
- **Performance Analytics Agent**: Monitors KPIs and detects growth opportunities
- (Planned) Publisher Adapter Framework: Generic publishing abstraction replacing the deprecated WordPress Manager role

### Web Scraping Infrastructure

A scalable web scraping system will gather market data from:

- Amazon product trends and reviews
- Google Shopping and Google Trends
- Social media platforms for trend detection
- Competitor blogs and affiliate networks

### Headless Content Layer

The prior WordPress-specific automation layer has been deprecated. The system now produces structured, optimization-ready article objects (title, summary, keywords, semantic entities, monetization context) that can be:

- Served via API to any downstream renderer
- Transformed into static site output (Next.js/SvelteKit/JAMStack adapter TBD)
- Enriched by forthcoming Knowledge Base + Semantic Retrieval modules
- Routed to optional publisher adapters (future: WordPress adapter resurrected only as a plugin-style module)

### SEO Tools Implementation

Free alternatives to expensive SEO services:

- **Google Keyword Planner Integration**: Free keyword research
- **SERP Analysis**: Direct scraping of search results
- **NLP Keyword Analysis**: Natural language processing for content optimization
- **Content Optimization**: AI-driven optimization without paid APIs

## Project Status

The project has completed the following phases:

1. ✅ Database setup and configuration
2. ✅ Frontend-Backend integration
3. ✅ API testing and verification
4. ✅ Multi-niche system implementation
5. ❌ (Removed) WordPress integration (decoupled in headless pivot)

Currently working on:

- Finalizing CRUD + headless article schema stability
- GPT-5 Marketing Stack knowledge base ingestion + retrieval augmentation
- Agent enrichment (content strategy + monetization logic)

Upcoming major development focuses:

1. Knowledge Base / Internal Marketing Ontology (topics, entities, intent clusters)
2. Retrieval-Augmented Content Generation (RAG pipeline)
3. Semantic Performance Feedback Loop (iterative optimization agent)
4. Multi-channel Publishing Adapters (static exporter first)
5. Market analytics system with web scraping

## Migration Strategy (Legacy → Headless GPT-5 Stack)

Phases executed / in progress:

1. Remove WordPress hard dependencies (DONE)
2. Normalize article + product schema for headless delivery (DONE / refining)
3. Introduce Knowledge Base (marketing ontology + entity graph) (IN PROGRESS)
4. Add Retrieval Layer (vector + symbolic hybrid) (PLANNED)
5. Refactor services → autonomous agents with tool interfaces (ONGOING)
6. Instrument feedback metrics (CTR proxy, semantic coverage, topical authority) (PLANNED)
7. Add publisher adapter abstraction (PLANNED)

## Research Pillars (Guiding the GPT-5 Marketing Stack)

## Legacy WordPress Deprecation & Database Note

Former fields removed from models (if you persisted old DB snapshots you may need a manual migration):

- Article.wordpress_post_id
- BlogInstance.wordpress_url / wordpress_username / wordpress_app_password (and related settings)

Recommended manual migration (SQLite example):

```sql
-- If legacy columns still exist, safely drop them (adjust table names to match actual schema)
ALTER TABLE article RENAME TO article_legacy_backup; -- backup if uncertain
-- Recreate article table without wordpress_post_id then copy data
-- (For production you would use Alembic; not yet integrated.)
```

`wordpress_service.py` retained only as a stub raising RuntimeError to avoid breakage in any stale imports. Remove imports to finalize cleanup.

## Headless Article Contract (Draft)

```json
{
    "id": 123,
    "title": "String",
    "slug": "kebab-case-string",
    "summary": "Concise abstract",
    "sections": [{"heading": "H2 text", "content": "Markdown or HTML-safe"}],
    "keywords": ["primary", "secondary"],
    "entities": ["BrandX", "ConceptY"],
    "calls_to_action": [{"type": "affiliate", "target": "vendor-id", "anchor": "Buy Now"}],
    "meta": {"read_time_minutes": 7, "semantic_density": 0.82},
    "source_attribution": [{"url": "https://...", "confidence": 0.74}],
    "created_at": "ISO8601",
    "updated_at": "ISO8601"
}
```

Planned additions: topical authority score, internal link suggestions, SERP gap insights.

---

## Knowledge Base Plan

Data Layers:
- Static Seed: curated marketing strategy docs (`/docs/*` + niche research)
- Dynamic Harvest: agent-scraped market & competitor signals
- Ontology: topics → subtopics → intents → entities → products
- Embedding Store: vector index for retrieval augmenting generation

Upcoming Implementation Files (planned):
- `src/services/knowledge_base.py` (loader + retrieval facade)
- `core/agents/content_strategy_agent.py` (RAG consumer)
- `core/agents/monetization_agent.py` (contextual offer selection)

## Development Quick Start

**For WARP Terminal users:** See `WARP.md` for comprehensive development commands and architecture guidance tailored for WARP's AI capabilities.

## Contributing (Internal)

1. Keep changes atomic; remove residual legacy WordPress references when encountered.
2. Prefer adding tests around new agent behaviors vs. retrofitting old services.
3. Document new JSON contracts in README before large refactors.
4. Refer to `WARP.md` for development workflow and testing strategies.

---

## Roadmap Snapshot (High-Level)

Q3/Q4 2025 Focus:
- Knowledge ingestion + RAG
- Content Strategy Agent
- Performance feedback & iterative optimization loops
- Static publishing adapter prototype

Deprioritized / Removed:
- Direct WordPress control (may return as optional adapter later)
