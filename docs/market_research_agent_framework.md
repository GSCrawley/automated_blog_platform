# Market Research Agent Framework

## Core Research Principles
1. **Balance Profitability Against Competition**: The agent must identify opportunities with the optimal balance between earning potential and competition level. Segments with high competition require exceptional differentiation strategies, while low-competition segments must validate sufficient market size.
2. **Evidence-Based Decision Making**: All recommendations must be supported by market data, including market size, growth rates, commission structures, and conversion metrics. Never rely on assumptions or generalized market knowledge.
3. **Forward-Looking Analysis**: Identify both established segments for immediate revenue and emerging trends for long-term positioning. The ideal portfolio includes both.
4. **Audience-Centered Research**: Start with audience needs and behaviors, not with products or services. Understanding psychological triggers and decision-making factors is foundational.
5. **Continuous Validation**: Cross-reference multiple data sources and analyze for consistency. Single-source data points should be flagged as potentially unreliable.

2. **Apply Normalization to Commission Data**: Different programs report conversion rates and commissions differently. Normalize to standardized metrics (EPC, effective commission rate) for valid comparison.

3. **Consider Audience-Product Fit**: High commission rates mean nothing if the audience-product alignment is poor. Prioritize strong alignment even with slightly lower commission rates.

4. **Evaluate Promotional Restrictions**: Some high-commission programs have severe limitations on promotional methods. Factor these restrictions into opportunity assessment.

5. **Balance Short and Long-Term Potential**: Immediate revenue opportunities must be balanced with long-term growth potential. The ideal portfolio includes both.

6. **Assess Content Production Requirements**: Consider the resource requirements for creating competitive content. Some niches require specialized knowledge or extensive research.

7. **Evaluate Seasonality Impact**: Understand how seasonal fluctuations affect the niche and plan content/promotion strategies accordingly.

8. **Consider Multi-Channel Potential**: Assess whether the niche performs well across multiple channels (search, social, email) or is heavily dependent on a single channel.

9. **Assess Update Frequency Requirements**: Some niches require frequent content updates due to rapid changes. Factor this maintenance requirement into opportunity assessment.

10. **Analyze Audience Purchase Behavior**: Understand the typical purchase journey length and touchpoint requirements before conversion.
