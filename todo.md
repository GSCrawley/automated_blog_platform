Plan: introduce Alembic migrations later; for now manual adjustment or fresh DB recommended.

## Next Immediate Steps:
1. (Task 2) Add Knowledge Base loader + ingestion pipeline
2. (Task 3) Update README (DONE) & finalize headless article contract draft (IN README)
3. (Task 1 - queued) Optionally remove `wordpress_service.py` stub after confirming no imports
4. (Task 4 - queued) Scaffold `src/services/knowledge_base.py` + tests
5. Add retrieval-enhanced generation path in content generator
1. Complete Phase 6 CRUD verification tasks
2. Create the base Agent class architecture
3. Implement the Orchestrator Agent
4. Set up the message broker (Redis)
